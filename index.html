                    The Path Ahead



                    A journey starts with steps so small,
                    
                    Yet each one leads, despite the fall.
                    
                    Through winding roads and skies so wide,
                    
                    The path unfolds with time as guide.
                    
                    
                    
                    The weight you bear, the dreams you chase,
                    
                    Are markers of your strength and grace.
                    
                    Through trials fierce and winds that wail,
                    
                    You rise again you will not fail.
                    
                    
                    
                    For in your heart, a fire glows,
                    
                    A light that only courage knows.
                    
                    Keep walking on, embrace the fight,
                    
                    The dawn will break you'll find your light.</pre

          <h3>Why i like Poems</h3>

          <p class="paragraph">
            I like poems because they have a way of capturing deep emotions and
            complex ideas in just a few words. They can be raw and powerful or
            soft and comforting, depending on the mood and message. Poetry has a
            rhythm that makes words feel alive, turning simple thoughts into
            something almost magical. It can express feelings that are hard to
            say out loud, offering both an escape and a way to connect with
            others. Whether itâ€™s a short verse or a long, flowing piece,
            poetry has the power to inspire, heal, and make people feel
            understood.
